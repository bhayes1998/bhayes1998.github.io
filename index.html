    			<p class="info">My name is Bryan Hayes and I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Miami Unviersity in 2021. I got my start in the world of technology and coding late in high school when my hardware class teacher introduced me to it. I started off with learning the basics of Java and have since branched out to several other languages such as C++, SQL, C#, HTML, JavaScript, and many more. I have had the time of my life learning all about the world of software engineering. Currently, I am working a full time position at Tata Consultancy Servcies.</p>

					<h3>Loan Shark [2020-2021]</h3>
					<div class="projectInfo">This was my senior capstone project at Miami that I worked on with a group of three other people. It is an Android mobile app designed to keep track of items that you have borrowed from someone or have lent out to someone, with integrated Google account support. It was written in Dart using the Flutter framework, with Google Firebase as our database solution. [Note: this project is owned by Miami University, so I am not permitted to share the source code. I have linked to the final project video instead.]</div>

					<h3>Toilet Talk [2019]</h3>
					<div class="projectInfo">The final project for my databases class.  This is a web app built from the ASP.NET framework that acts as a review site for all of the bathrooms on Miami Universities campus.  Users could leave short reviews and bathrooms as well as give them a rating.  Each bathroom page contained some info about the bathroom such as number of sinks/stalls, as well as the allowed gender.  Reviews were stored in a MySQL database.</div>

					<h3>Running App [2020]</h3>
					<div class="projectInfo">My final project for my mobile apps class.  It is a basic running app that can store the users run time, distance, and date.  After a run is added, it can be updated or deleted, with each run being stored in a SQLite database.  Users can also see their yearly, monthly, and weekly totals visually represented in a bar graph, as well as calculate their age grade for a set of distances.  </div>

					<h3>Unity Projects [2020]</h3>
					<div class="projectInfo">A collection of the projects I did for my game design class.  I couldn't decide which one I liked the best, so I've included all of them.  The labs are mostly one-off learning exercises, but the three projects show off more of what I was capable of in Unity.  The first project was a carnival-style shooter in the form of naval warfare, the second project is a katamari game, and the thrid is a basic capture the flag shooter.  All of these projects were created in Unity using C# for scripting.</div>

					<div class="projectInfo">This was a fun Java project that I did for my comparative programming languages class.  It involves a made-up basic programming language called Z+-, which can do very simple math as well as single and nested for loops.  The program reads in a text file containg the Z+- code and parses through it to decide what to do.</div>

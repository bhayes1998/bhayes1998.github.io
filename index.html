    			<p class="info">My name is Bryan Hayes and I am a Computer Science student at Miami University. I got my start in the world of technology and coding late in high school when my hardware class teacher introduced me to it. I started off with learning the basics of Java and have since branched out to several other languages such as C++, SQL, and HTML. I have had the time of my life learning all about the world of software engineering. Currently, I am taking part in a remote internship at Tata Consultancy Services.</p>

    			<h2>Projects</h2>
    			<p>Below you can find some projects I have done in my time at Miami.  Some of these are assignments I did for school, and some of them are personal projects.  You can also find a link to the Github project page for each one.</p>

    			<h3>Z+- Interpreter [2020]</h3>
    			<p>This was a fun Java project that I did for my comparative programming languages class.  It involves a made-up basic programming language called Z+-, which can do very simple math as well as single and nested for loops.  The program reads in a text file containg the Z+- code and parses through it to decide what to do.</p>

    			<h3>Basic Command Shell [2019]</h3>
    			<p>A C++ project created for my systems class that creates a Linux command terminal and can perform basic Linux commands.  It involves forking and manipulating child processes using the execvp() function.  The given commands can be done serial or in parallel.</p>

    			<h3>Toilet Talk [2019]</h3>
    			<p>The final project for my databases class.  This is a web app built from the ASP.NET framework that acts as a review site for all of the bathrooms on Miami Universities campus.  Users could leave short reviews and bathrooms as well as give them a rating.  Each bathroom page contained some info about the bathroom such as number of sinks/stalls, as well as the allowed gender.  Reviews were stored in a MySQL database.</p>

    			<h3>Game Design Projects [2020]</h3>
    			<p>A collection of the three major projects I did for my game design class.  I couldn't decide which one I liked the best, so I've included all of them.  The first project was a carnival-style shooter in the form of naval warfare, the second project is a katamari game, and the thrid is a basic capture the flag shooter.  All of these projects were created in Unity.</p>

    			<h3>Running App [2020]</h3>
    			<p>My final project for my mobile apps class.  It is a basic running app that can store the users run time, distance, and date.  After a run is added, it can be updated or deleted, with each run being stored in a SQLite database.  Users can also see their yearly, monthly, and weekly totals visually represented in a bar graph, as well as calculate their age grade for a set of distances.  </p>

    			<h3>[Insert final name of website here] [2020]</h3>
    			<p>This very website!  I created this page almost solely for the purpose of teaching myself HTML and CSS.  I have previously not had much experience in web development, so I thought this would be the most useful way to introduce myslef to it.</p>
